# banking-tdd

This is a Test-Driven Development (TDD) practice project that walks you through the exercise of building a simple banking service, using TDD best practices.


## Exercise #1

* Let's add our first test case. Use `src/test/java` to place a new test class, e.g. `example.banking.services.BankingServiceTest`. Notice, that the test class doesn't compile, because few components do not resolve, e.g. `@Test` and `Assert`.
* Let's add JUnit 4 libraries to Maven dependencies (e.g. `artifactId=junit`,`groupId=junit`,`version=4.12`). Don't forget to update Maven project (e.g. `ALT-F5`). Organize imports in `BankingServiceTest` class (e.g. `CTRL+SHIFT+O`).
